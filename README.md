Dart is the programming language for Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled mobile, web, and desktop apps from a single codebase.

## About Intro to Dart

This repository introduces you to Dart with a focus on features that Java developers might not expect. You can write Dart functions in 1 minute, scripts in 5 minutes and applications in 10 minutes!

## What you will need

[DartPad](https://dartpad.dev), an interactive browser-based tool that lets you play around with the Dart language features and core libraries. Upon request, you can use an IDE instead, such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the Dart plugin, or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Dart Code extension.
